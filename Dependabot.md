Enabling Dependabot in Github:
==
- Code exists in github only
- Once we enable the Dependabot, it will scan the dependencies.
- It will alert in case of any bugs or vulnerabilities and provides the details/fixes.
- Click Security -> Dependabot -> click "this repository’s settings."
- Click Dependency alerts.
- Click Secuirty -> Dependabot -> Click the alert.

Example:
==
**Node-Redis potential exponential regex in monitor mode #1**
**Impact**
When a client is in monitoring mode, the regex begin used to detected monitor messages could cause exponential backtracking on some strings. This issue could lead to a denial of service.

**Patches**
The problem was fixed in commit 2d11b6d and was released in version 3.1.1.

**References**
#1569 (GHSL-2021-026)

**CVSS v3 base metrics**
- Attack vector               Network
- Attack complexity           Low
- Privileges required         None
- User interaction            None
- Scope                       Unchanged
- Confidentiality             None
- Integrity                   None
- Availability                High

Metrics
==
- **Attack vector**: More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Attack complexity**: More severe for the least complex attacks.
- **Privileges required**: More severe if no privileges are required.
- **User interaction**: More severe when no user interaction is required.
- **Scope**: More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.
- **Confidentiality**: More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.
- **Integrity**: More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.
- **Availability**: More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Actions when Dependabot generates an alert?
===
1. Query the dependabot alert (Using the rest API).
2. You will get a Json response.
3. If its a Critical/High alert, stop the pipeline.
4. In case the alert is medium, continue with the pipeline.

Configure pipeline, to read the alerts generated by dependabot
==
- Github account -> Developer settings -> create clasic token.
- Select all scopes and click create.
- Jenkins -> Manage -> Credentials -> Secret text -> Name:GITHUB_TOKEN, apply the code and save.
